# Simulate the number of pages read by each undergraduate per day

# Assuming Ash and Jacki are a couple, making Ash's readings positively correlated with Jacki's
ash <- jacki + rnorm(days, mean=0, sd=5)

# Combine into a data frame
readings <- data.frame(day=1:days, matt=matt, ash=ash, jacki=jacki, rol=rol, mike=mike)

#write a csv file
write.csv(readings, file = "readings.csv")

# Example tests - replace with your specific tests
# Test 1: Summary of readings by Matt
summary(readings$matt)

# Test 2: Correlation between Ash and Jacki
cor(readings$ash, readings$jacki)

# Test 3: Average pages read per day by all undergraduates
colMeans(readings[,-1])

# Test 4: Days with more than 60 pages read by Matt
length(which(readings$matt > 60))

# Test 5: Linear model of Ash's readings as a function of Jacki's
lm_ash_jacki <- lm(ash ~ jacki, data=readings)
